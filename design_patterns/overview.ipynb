    "- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.\n",
    "- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.\n",
    "- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n",
    "- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.\n",
    "- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structural Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.\n",
    "- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.\n",
    "- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.\n",
    "- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.\n",
    "- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.\n",
    "- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing instances.\n",
    "- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavioral Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler can either handle the request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain.\n",
    "- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.\n",
    "- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences of the language.\n",
    "- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.\n",
    "- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.\n",
    "- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to that state later.\n",
    "- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\n",
    "- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object has changed its class.\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.\n",
    "- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.\n",
    "- **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class without changing the class itself, by separating algorithms from the objects on which they operate.\n"
