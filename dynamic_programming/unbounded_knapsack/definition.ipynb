    "### **Unbounded Knapsack Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Unbounded Knapsack Problem** is a variation of the knapsack problem where you have an unlimited supply of each item. The objective is to maximize the total value you can carry in a knapsack with a fixed capacity, while being allowed to take as many copies of an item as you want, as long as the total weight doesn't exceed the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Capacity**: The maximum weight the knapsack can hold.\n",
    "- **Items**: Each item has a weight and a value.\n",
    "- **Unlimited Quantity**: You can take **as many copies** of each item as you want.\n",
    "- **Goal**: Maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.\n",

    "Everything including the initialization, return type, matrix size, etc is of unbounded knapsack is same, the only key difference is that we'll be able to use same item multiple times.\n",
