    "# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** is a classic problem in computer science, particularly in string comparison and dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two sequences (strings or arrays), the task is to find the **length of their longest common subsequence**. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily consecutively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `X` and `Y` be two sequences:\n",
    "- `X = x1, x2, ..., xm` (length = `m`)\n",
    "- `Y = y1, y2, ..., yn` (length = `n`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the length of the **longest subsequence** that is present in both `X` and `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `X = \"ABCBDAB\"`\n",
    "2. `Y = \"BDCABB\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the longest common subsequence is `\"BCAB\"`, which has a length of `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Subsequence**: A subsequence is derived by deleting some (or none) of the characters in a sequence without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: The LCS is the longest sequence that is a subsequence of both `X` and `Y`.\n",
    "- The LCS does **not** require the elements to be consecutive, but they must appear in the same relative order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two strings `X = \"ABCBDAB\"` and `Y = \"BDCABB\"`. We can identify several subsequences common to both, such as:\n",
    "- `\"BCAB\"` (length = 4)\n",
    "- `\"BDAB\"` (length = 4)\n",
    "- `\"BAB\"` (length = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The longest of these is `\"BCAB\"`, so the LCS length is `4`.\n"
