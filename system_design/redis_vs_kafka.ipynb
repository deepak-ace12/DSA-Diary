    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis and Kafka serve very different purposes, and using them interchangeably can lead to performance issues and data loss. Here's a brief breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Redis** is an in-memory cache and real-time data store. It’s optimized for low-latency, high-throughput operations, making it ideal for scenarios like session management, caching, and real-time analytics. However, its message delivery is not reliable (no guarantees), and its data is ephemeral (can be lost if evicted or consumed). It’s not built for large-scale, persistent message storage or complex consumer patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kafka** is a distributed, durable event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant message storage. It’s ideal for event-driven architectures, data pipelines, and stream processing, where events need to be reliably stored and processed by multiple consumers over time. Kafka guarantees message delivery and allows for replayability of events, but has slightly higher latency compared to Redis due to its disk-based storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Redis for fast, temporary data storage with real-time access and low-latency requirements.\n",
    "Use Kafka for durable, high-volume message streaming with long-term storage and fault tolerance.\n"
